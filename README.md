# MIMIC-extract
We aims to develop a reliable and easy-to-use extraction pipeline to standardize data extraction from MIMIC datasets. Our method can fully integrate different data structures, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, into a time-series table. In addition, we propose a pipeline parallelization method to reduce the time of data extraction


MIMIC-III Extract
Mimic data were extracted in Early Prediction of Sepsis fromClinical Data â€“ the PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019 format
The data are divided into three parts: vital signs, laboratory data and demographic data
Columns are the number of features,
Each row is an average of the patient's hourly feature data
